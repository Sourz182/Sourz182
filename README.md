- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh, @Sourz182
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming, networking and network infrastructure, fiber installation and managment, general IT knowledge and managment, and even some micro electronics/hardware assembly/programing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and any other languages that I can wrap my head around.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, still too green and inexperienced.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't really have any socials at the moment beyond my email.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have had four kidneys throughout my life :)
